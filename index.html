      <h2>Nanoparticles</h2>
      <p>
        Nanoparticles are incredibly small particles with dimensions typically
        measured in nanometers (nm), which is one billionth of a meter. Due to their
        tiny size, nanoparticles exhibit unique properties that differ from those of
        their bulk counterparts. They can be engineered to possess specific
        characteristics, making them highly versatile and valuable in a wide range of
        applications.

      <h2>Properties</h2>
      <p>
        Nanoparticles can have different shapes, compositions, and surface
        properties, leading to a diverse array of applications. Some nanoparticles
        exhibit magnetic, optical, or catalytic properties, while others are
        biocompatible or have antimicrobial effects. Understanding these properties
        is key to leveraging nanoparticles effectively in various scientific and
        technological endeavors.

    <div class="importance">
      <h2>Importance</h2>
      <p>
        Nanoparticles play a crucial role in numerous industries, including medicine,
        electronics, materials science, and environmental science. Their small size
        and unique properties enable breakthroughs in drug delivery, disease
        diagnosis, renewable energy, water purification, and much more. Understanding
        nanoparticles is essential for unlocking their full potential and harnessing
        their benefits for society.
