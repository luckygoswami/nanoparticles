          <h3>Targeted Drug Delivery:</h3>
          <p>
            Nanoparticles can be used as carriers for drugs, delivering them directly
            to diseased cells and reducing side effects. Researchers are developing
            nanoparticles that can recognize specific biomarkers on cancer cells.
            Nanoparticles disguised as human platelets could greatly enhance the
            healing power of drug treatments for cardiovascular disease and systemic
            bacterial infections. These platelet-mimicking nanoparticles, developed
            by engineers at the University of California, San Diego, are capable of
            delivering drugs to targeted sites in the bodyâ€”particularly injured blood
            vessels, as well as organs infected by harmful bacteria. Engineers
            demonstrated that by delivering the drugs just to the areas where the
            drugs were needed, these platelet copycats greatly increased the
            therapeutic effects of drugs that were administered to diseased rats and
            mice.
