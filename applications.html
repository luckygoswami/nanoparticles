          NPs can be engineered to have unique compositions and functionalities. For
          example, they can be used to image biological processes at the cellular
          level and detect analytes at the attomolar range. NPs can also be used for
          gene and drug delivery, fluorescent biological labels, detection of
          proteins, bio-detection of pathogens, and tissue engineering.

        <h2>Medical Imaging</h2>
        <p>
          NPs are used in medical equipment for the diagnosis of several illnesses.
          For example, magnetite nanoparticles are used in magnetic resonance imaging
          (MRI) for scanning purposes.

        <h2>Environmental remediation</h2>
        <p>
          NPs are used for the treatment of hazardous waste materials and water
          sources. They can also be used to remove toxic metal ions, disease causing
          microbes, and organic and inorganic solutes from water.

        <h2>Nanocomposites</h2>
        <p>
          NPs are used as nanoclays to form nanocomposites. These nanocomposites have
          an ultra large surface area to volume ratio and can help enhance material
          properties and degradation. Kidney transplants
