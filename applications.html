          NPs can be engineered to have unique compositions and functionalities. For
          example, they can be used to image biological processes at the cellular
          level and detect analytes at the attomolar range. NPs can also be used for
          gene and drug delivery, fluorescent biological labels, detection of
          proteins, bio-detection of pathogens, and tissue engineering.

          Clay nanoparticles, when incorporated into polymer matrices, increase
          reinforcement, leading to stronger plastics, verifiable by a higher glass
          transition temperature and other mechanical property tests. These
          nanoparticles are hard, and impart their properties to the polymer
          (plastic). Nanoparticles have also been attached to textile fibers in order
          to create smart and functional clothing.
