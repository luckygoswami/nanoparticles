        <p>
          Clay nanoparticles, when incorporated into polymer matrices, increase
          reinforcement, leading to stronger plastics, verifiable by a higher glass
          transition temperature and other mechanical property tests. These
          nanoparticles are hard, and impart their properties to the polymer
          (plastic). Nanoparticles have also been attached to textile fibers in order
          to create smart and functional clothing.
