            Nanosafety is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on assessing and
            managing the potential risks associated with nanotechnology, particularly
            the use of nanoparticles and nanomaterials. As nanotechnology continues
            to advance and find applications in various industries such as
            healthcare, electronics, and materials science, understanding and
            addressing safety concerns become crucial.

              are particles with dimensions typically ranging from 1 to 100
              nanometers (nm) in at least one dimension. They exhibit unique physical

                  Nanoparticles can induce oxidative stress by generating reactive

                  Nanoparticles can activate inflammatory responses in tissues and

          <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
          <p>
            Nanomaterials present unique challenges in terms of environmental impact
            due to their novel properties and potential interactions with natural
            ecosystems. Studies have shown that nanoparticles can behave differently
            from larger particles, affecting their fate, transport, and
            transformation in air, water, and soil environments. In aquatic systems,
            for instance, nanoparticles can aggregate, sediment, or be taken up by
            organisms, altering nutrient cycles and potentially affecting food webs.
            Similarly, in soils, nanomaterials can influence microbial communities
            and nutrient availability. The ecological risks associated with
            nanomaterials include potential toxicity to organisms and unknown
            long-term impacts on ecosystem health. Understanding the behavior of
            nanoparticles in natural environments is crucial for assessing and
            mitigating their environmental impacts.
