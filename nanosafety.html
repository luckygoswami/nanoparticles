            Nanosafety is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on assessing and
            managing the potential risks associated with nanotechnology, particularly
            the use of nanoparticles and nanomaterials. As nanotechnology continues
            to advance and find applications in various industries such as
            healthcare, electronics, and materials science, understanding and
            addressing safety concerns become crucial.

            <h3>Nanoparticles</h3>
            <p class="details">
              are particles with dimensions typically ranging from 1 to 100
              nanometers (nm) in at least one dimension. They exhibit unique physical
              and chemical properties due to their small size and large surface
              area-to-volume ratio, making them desirable for various applications
              but also raising concerns about potential health and environmental
              impacts.

            <h3>Nanomaterials</h3>
            <p class="details">
              refer to materials that contain nanoparticles or structures with
              dimensions at the nanoscale. They can be engineered to have specific
              properties for use in electronics, medicine, cosmetics, and other
              fields. Common types of nanomaterials include carbon nanotubes, quantum
              dots, and metal nanoparticles.

            <h3>Nanotoxicology</h3>
            <p class="details">
              is the study of the toxicity and biological effects of nanomaterials on
              living organisms, including humans and the environment. It involves
              investigating how nanoparticles interact with cells, tissues, and
              biological systems, as well as understanding the mechanisms of toxicity
              and potential health risks associated with exposure.
