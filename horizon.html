              As of September 2018, it has been estimated that 11 million American
              homes have been powered by solar energy, amounting to a total installed
              solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity of 58.3 gigawatts (GW)1. As the global
              interest in alternative energy continues to rise, researchers have
              continued to investigate different ways to improve the efficiency of
              converting solar energy into an electrical voltage.

                One of the biggest disadvantages of solar energy is the high cost
                associated with manufacturing solar cells, especially when compared
                to the cost of utilizing coal and gas for energy. Furthermore, modern
                solar cells can lose as much as 10% of acquired power as a result of
                direct optical loses, since the surface of these cells will reflect
                anywhere between 2% - 10% of incoming sunlight. Nanotechnology offers
                the ability to solve this problem. Since nanostructures typically are
                only a few hundred nanometers in size, they create an interface
                between the air and the nanostructure, particularly those comprised
                of silicon, become graded rather than planar. This change in the
                solar cells' design allows for light to be precisely guided and
                absorbed into the cell, rather than reflected away.

                Silicon nanoparticles exhibit many useful properties, some of which
                include an active surface state, low bulk density as well as unique
                photoluminescent and biocompatible properties. As a result, these
                nanoparticles are often incorporated into lithium-ion batteries,
                solar energy cells, micro, and integrated semiconductors and
                luminescent display devices2. When applied for solar power products,
                the size and microstructure of silicon nanoparticles, as well as
                their luminescence and quantum efficiency properties are highly
                specific.

                A recent study conducted in Russia investigated a novel technological
                process for the production of nanosilicon films that could be applied
                to solar cells. This process involves synthesizing solid silicon
                oxide (SiO) monoxide, following by disproportionation of solid SiO
                following heat treatment of the material. Finally, the silicon
                nanoparticles were separated from the products that resulted from the
                heat treatment of SiO4. As a result of these processes, the extremely
                fine silicon particles remained bound to the SiO matrix until they
                were removed by etching the particles into a hydrofluoric acid
                solution. Not only did this technique ensure that the particle
                dimensions remained within the 2 to 10 nanometer (nm) range, but it
                also provided good antireflective and passivation properties without
                compromising the purity of the final product. As a result, the
                manufacturing process developed in this study produced nanosilicon
                that is optimal for solar cells applications4.

                As research has continued to support the incorporation of
                nanotechnology and solar technology, the use of resonant colloidal
                nanoparticles has been shown to improve the performance of halide
                perovskite solar cells that are derived from organometals.
                Furthermore, resonant metallic nanoparticles, when incorporated into
                these solar cells, have successfully increased light absorption and
                charge separation to ultimately improve the efficiency of applied
                solar panels. To avoid the potential reactivity of the metallic
                nanoparticles with the perovskite halides, a recent study applied
                photocurrent and fill-factor enhancements to organometal halide
                perovskite solar cells that also contain resonant silicon
                nanoparticles between its active layers. This study found that the
                overall efficiency of the solar cells improved by as much as 18.8%,
                whereas fill factor, which is a parameter that determines the maximum
                power that can be obtained from the solar cell, increased by a
                staggering 79%5.
