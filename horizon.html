              As of September 2018, it has been estimated that 11 million American
              homes have been powered by solar energy, amounting to a total installed
              solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity of 58.3 gigawatts (GW)1. As the global
              interest in alternative energy continues to rise, researchers have
              continued to investigate different ways to improve the efficiency of
              converting solar energy into an electrical voltage.
