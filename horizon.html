              As of September 2018, it has been estimated that 11 million American
              homes have been powered by solar energy, amounting to a total installed
              solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity of 58.3 gigawatts (GW)1. As the global
              interest in alternative energy continues to rise, researchers have
              continued to investigate different ways to improve the efficiency of
              converting solar energy into an electrical voltage.

                One of the biggest disadvantages of solar energy is the high cost
                associated with manufacturing solar cells, especially when compared
                to the cost of utilizing coal and gas for energy. Furthermore, modern
                solar cells can lose as much as 10% of acquired power as a result of
                direct optical loses, since the surface of these cells will reflect
                anywhere between 2% - 10% of incoming sunlight. Nanotechnology offers
                the ability to solve this problem. Since nanostructures typically are
                only a few hundred nanometers in size, they create an interface
                between the air and the nanostructure, particularly those comprised
                of silicon, become graded rather than planar. This change in the
                solar cells' design allows for light to be precisely guided and
                absorbed into the cell, rather than reflected away.
